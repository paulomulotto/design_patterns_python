    "The Builder Pattern is one of the most commom pattern. It is usefull when you need to initiate an object with many parameters.\n",

    "Imagine the following scenario. You have a class that takes 10 parameters and you need to control and validade all of those parameters. If you only have one initializer to do this, you need to input all of these parameters on one line and manage them in the body function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be difficult to understand and if you need to change this code in future, it will be difficult to test and ensure that you have not broken anything because you will change the heart of the class. Ideally you should never change a code, just extend it. We use the builder pattern to do this.\n",
